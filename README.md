# Deep Learning: Indian Food Classification Project
## An Nguyen, Hope Tsai

In a new culinary environment, even a translated menu might not be enough to make a decision on which dish to order. Some ingredients might be entirely new, and some translations might not be accurate. Instead, a better route might be matching photographs of food to an existing database of dishes. In this project, we will focus on Indian food, classifying images into different Indian dishes. We will use multiple datasets from the site Kaggle, in order to prevent overfitting our model. To determine what type of model is more accurate, we will use both pre-trained and randomly initialized models. We will also experiment with the method **"N-Shot Learning,"** in which one trains networks on **N** images per category, varying **N**. We hope to discover if there exists an optimal number of images per category, or if the phrase *"more is better"* holds. After this project, we aim to have an accurate classification model that can be altered and used on different food datasets, such as Hungarian cuisine.
